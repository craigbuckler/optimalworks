Successful builders live in the worst homes. It's also true that successful developers have the worst websites because they're too busy building sites and applications for other people. That's my excuse.

It's been a hectic decade. Numerous client projects, hundreds of SitePoint articles, video courses, and conference presentations meant that the website redesign got put at the bottom of the priority list. Even this one could be generously called a Minimum Viable Product!

Don't let that put you off! We're happy to consider new projects.


## Old articles
I'm afraid they've gone. So have the comments. While they may have been interesting to historians, I'm not convinced people wanted to read about IE7 issues or use old Vista-like CSS effects. I'm happy to let you have the WordPress database, though.


## Technology
My old site was WordPress powered. I still love WordPress but it's overkill for most sites and it was a pain to maintain the installation.

The new site is built using a Static Site Generator which renders markdown files into HTML templates. The technology stack includes [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) and [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) combined with an assortment of off-the-shelf and custom plugins.

The site is responsive and a Progressive Web App. On mobile, you may be prompted to add it to your home screen and it has offline functionality when supported.
