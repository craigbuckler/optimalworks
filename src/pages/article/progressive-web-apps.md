All our websites and apps have been implemented as Progressive Web Apps (PWA) since 2016. The concept is new so clients rarely ask for a PWA, but it seems irresponsible *not* to add the technologies. The benefits are considerable:

* users can easily add your site/app to their mobile or desktop home screen
* performance is improved because files can be cached on-demand or in advance
* sites/apps can be made to work offline
* PWA technology can normally be applied to existing web sites and applications
* they can be updated like normal web applications without App Store complexities
* PWAs can be hundreds of times smaller and more efficient than native mobile apps
* functionality still works everywhere - *even when a device doesn't support PWA technologies*.

PWAs use standard web development APIs and are already supported in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi, and Brave. Edge and Safari are coming soon.


## Web agency support
Unfortunately, few web development agencies have adopted PWA techniques. Clients don't know it's an option and developers often lack appropriate knowledge. However, the core concepts are simple:

1. Enable secure HTTPS (preferably HTTP/2) on your system.
1. Create a [web app manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) with information about your app's name, icons, colours etc.
1. Create a [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers). This is the root of PWA complexity but even an empty file will enable some functionality.


Please [contact us]([root]contact/) to discuss how:

* your site or application could become a Progressive Web App, or
* your developers could benefit from a few hours PWA training.
