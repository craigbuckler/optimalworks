## Craig Buckler: director and developer

I have devoted most of my career to the open web. The technology changes rapidly but the core approach remains the same: *this is for everyone*.

> this is for everyone

I have worked with many organisations throughout the industry but also take on smaller projects. Even the newest start-up company can provide stunning online services which change the way people use the web.
