OptimalWorks Ltd was founded by Craig and Claire Buckler in 2006. While we are primarily a technology company, our aim is to help organisations build their business.


## Craig Buckler, director and developer
I have devoted most of my career to the open web. The technologies change rapidly but the core approach remains the same: *this is for everyone*.

> this is for everyone
<cite>Tim Berners-Lee, web developer</cite>

I have worked with big names in the industry but also take on smaller projects which interest me. Even the most cash-strapped start-up company can provide stunning online services which change the way people use the web.
